# CollectTheRainbowRepo
 This is a video game following Michi the mushroom in their quest to fix their rainbow teleporter and find their friend Piro. This project is a component for my appliction to the Clemson DPA MFA program. To create this project I used Unity, C# with Visual Studios, Blender for 3D models, Procreate for UI Elements and some models textures, and Chrome Music Lab for music and jumping sound effects. 
 
The scripts I created and used are located under Collect the Rainbow > Assets. Their names are as follows: </br>
* IntroNavigaton.cs
* Level.cs
* Main.cs
* MushroomMovement.cs
* Orb.cs
* Orbs.cs
* Platform.cs
* SoundSettings.cs

Open the application file to play the game. You may run into an error opening it due to difficulties with the Apple Notarization process. If this is the case, you can still open the application by going to Settings> Security & Privacy> General> and choosing 'Open Anway' by the CollectTheRainbow_Mac application. </br>

## Compilation Instructions
In order to compile this code, you will need to have the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/developer-tools) installed. To create this application, I used Unity Version 2021.1.5f1 with Mac and Windows Build Support installs. You can play the application from within the editor, or create your own build by selecting File > Build Settings > and choosing 'Build & Run'.
